# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, I created A program using c++ that first reads a list of foods. It then will create a list counting the frequency of each item. Next, will save a backup of this information to a .dat file
The program will then display a menu to the user for item lookup and frequency selections. This program is intended to be used as a grocery store tool. For this project, I feel as though I excelled at manipulating the vectors that were created throughout
the project. I had a few stored to be accessed through various menu options. Throughout the code however, there were certainly areas that could be approved upon. For instance, error checking is really lacking. If you were to input a character 
into the menu input, it would break the whole application. 

Throughout this project, by far the most challenging part was manipulating the vectors for the certain menu functions. It took quite a lot of researching and re-reading of past material to really fine tune how I wanted
each vector to be created and finally called upon. The skills I learned from this part in addition to segmenting my code into classes I feel will easily transfer over into other projects I will develop throughout my
career and education.

In order to make this program maintainable, I have uploaded here, to keep track of any changes and track progress. As for readability, by adding comments and discussion here, hopefully anyone can see my thought process throughout the application.
